Introduction
------------
FftScope is the first released external visualization scope for AlsaPlayer
It will hopefully be a good starting point for others.
The scope API is generic enough to be useful in other projects.
The ultimate goal is to create a system wide visualization by either tapping
straight into ALSA or the jack sound server.

Building
--------
Make sure you have AlsaPlayer installed, including the development files
(libalsaplayer-version-dev if you are using a packaging system). Running
./configure && make && make install should build and install the FFTscope
on your system. You will have to restart a running alsaplayer for the new
scope to show up.
